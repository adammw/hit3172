Core Exercise 2: Blackjack Iteration 2
======================================

This program:

1. Creates a Deck object
2. Draws 52 cards from the Deck object, for each of these Card objects:
 * Print the card's description (to string)
 * Turn the card over
 * Print the card's description (to string) again
3. Shuffle the deck.
4. Repeat the code from step 2
5. Try drawing an additional card (should get null/nil). Test to check this is the case.

52 card objects are created when the deck is initalised.
